# Black-Fox
Black Fox is a lightweight Roblox Exploit built on the WeAreDevs Exploit API

# Getting Started 
You will first need a DLL Injector, We recommend this one https://wearedevs.net/d/DLL%20Injector.
(We also included it in the folder)

After you have installed the DLL Injector, Inject the DLL provided in the folder titled "InjectME"
than run the exploit and press "Launch"

# Help
Make sure to **Exclude** Black Fox and "InjectMe.DLL" from your antivirus as it will give off a false positive.

If you need help with anything please feel free to open a issue
